## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### 1. **How to use with Claude Code / AI Coding Agents**

- Each `.md` file is a self-contained prompt/package for Claude Code or similar AI coding tools.
- **For rapid prototyping:**  
  1. Open each file in order (start with `01-mini-prd.md`).
  2. Use as prompt/input in Claude Code to generate working source code, or use as reference for manual coding.
  3. For each phase, review output, check against acceptance criteria and quality checklist.
  4. Use `05-sync-guide.md` for integrating Google Sheets and automatic report emails.

### 2. **For Developers**

- Clone/download the markdown files.
- Use the architecture and dev tasks to scaffold your project (Next.js, Supabase, Netlify).
- All requirements, wireframes, and implementation notes are in markdown for easy copy-paste.
- Quality checklists are included to ensure you meet BMAD-Mini standards (performance, security, mobile-first, etc).

### 3. **For Project Managers/Stakeholders**

- Review the PRD and architecture to validate scope and approach before coding.
- Use wireframes to align on UI/UX and features.
- Track progress using dev tasks and checklists.
