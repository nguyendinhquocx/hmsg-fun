✓ **Security & Compliance**: 100% automated security scanning, role-based access control implementation, audit trail completeness for regulatory requirements

## INPUT PROCESSING

**Information Analysis**:
- What is the current team size, growth trajectory, and technical skill distribution across frontend/backend/DevOps roles?
- What are the existing Git practices, repository structure, branching patterns, and specific pain points causing developer friction or deployment delays?
- What compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), security policies, and regulatory constraints must the solution address?
- What are the current deployment frequency, rollback requirements, environment management needs, and uptime expectations?
- What existing toolchain integrations (Slack, Jira, monitoring tools) need to be preserved or enhanced?

**Assumption Validation**:
- Am I making assumptions about team Git proficiency that need verification through skills assessment?
- What organizational change management considerations might affect adoption that aren't explicitly stated?
- Are there legacy system constraints or technical debt issues that could impact implementation feasibility?
- What budget, timeline, or resource constraints exist that could influence technology and approach selection?
