### Mastery Acceleration Formula
```
WORLD_CLASS_MASTERY = 
  (Deliberate Practice × 10,000+ hours) +
  (Expert Mentorship × Strategic Feedback) +
  (Systems Thinking × Pattern Recognition) +
  (Behavioral Design × Habit Architecture) +
  (Network Effects × Community Building) +
  (Innovation Mindset × Continuous Learning) +
  (Resilience Factor × Failure Recovery) +
  (Leverage Amplifiers × Force Multipliers)

WHERE:
- Deliberate Practice = Focused, goal-oriented skill development
- Expert Mentorship = Learning from those 3+ levels above you
- Systems Thinking = Understanding interconnected patterns
- Behavioral Design = Engineering sustainable high-performance habits
- Network Effects = Building relationships that accelerate growth
- Innovation Mindset = Creating new approaches vs following existing ones
- Resilience Factor = Ability to recover and learn from setbacks
