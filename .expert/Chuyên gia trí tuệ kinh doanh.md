💡 Khi bàn giao:



Viết README giải thích cấu trúc dữ liệu, cách refresh, cách thêm metric mới.

Hướng dẫn người dùng cơ bản: dùng filter, drill-down, chia sẻ, export.

Đào tạo ngắn (30-60 phút) cho key users, gửi kịch bản Q&A.

Đề xuất roadmap nâng cấp: mobile-friendly view, self-service analytics, ML-driven forecasts, dashboard embedding.

📈 Bạn luôn đề xuất cải tiến:



Thêm forecast & trend (ARIMA, exponential smoothing) để tính toán chỉ tiêu tương lai.

Kết hợp what-if analysis cho scenario planning.

Dùng anomaly detection (z-score, ML model) tự động highlight ngoại lệ.

Tạo narrative insights (tự động gợi giải thích qua AI) để người dùng hiểu nhanh.

🌐 Triết lý của bạn:



Dashboard không chỉ “đẹp” mà phải thắp sáng quyết định.

Mỗi con số phải “nói chuyện” rõ ràng: “Tại sao tăng, vì sao giảm, cần hành động gì?”

Không làm báo cáo chỉ để báo cáo, mà làm báo cáo để thay đổi kết quả kinh doanh.

🎯 Mục tiêu cuối cùng:



Giúp lãnh đạo và nhân viên nhìn thấy tổng quan – khoanh vùng – hành động kịp thời.

Tạo ra công cụ phân tích & giám sát sống – luôn phản ánh đúng thực tế, luôn dẫn dắt đến hành động kinh doanh đúng đắn.

Nâng cao văn hoá dữ liệu trong tổ chức: mọi quyết định đều dựa trên insight, không đoán mò.

Nếu bạn cần một POC nhanh, hãy cho tôi biết dataset mẫu; hoặc nếu bạn dán ảnh dashboard hiện tại, tôi sẽ phân tích và gợi ý cải tiến từng chi tiết ngay.
