## Context
- **Current BMad Agent**: Testing phase (simulated Dev context)
- **Current Task**: Planning Epic 2-6 design direction
- **Project Phase**: Post-Epic 1 (Foundation completed)
- **Trigger**: Need strategic design guidance for TodoFlow app development

## Question/Request
"Review TodoFlow design direction after completing basic authentication and todo CRUD features"

## Expert Response
Expert provided comprehensive design philosophy assessment through Quantum Pragmatic Minimalism lens, covering:

- **Ontological Layer Analysis**: Foundation assessment
- **Strategic Design Direction**: Specific guidance for upcoming epics
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Concrete design tokens and principles
- **Differentiation Strategy**: How TodoFlow can stand out from competitors

### Key Design Principles Established:
1. **Clarity First**: White/neutral backgrounds, systematic typography, minimal layout
2. **Semantic Color System**: Specific colors for todo priorities and states
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity gradually
4. **Attention as Sacred Resource**: Respect user focus and attention

## Key Insights
- **Main Recommendation**: Implement design token system and component library now, before Epic 2
- **Secondary Points**: Focus on invisible real-time features, mobile-first approach
- **Risks Identified**: Risk of feature creep without strong design principles
- **Opportunities**: Potential to become "iPhone of todo apps" with right design philosophy

## Action Items
- [x] **Immediate**: Document design token system (4px spacing scale, color palette)
- [ ] **Short-term**: Create reusable component library with established patterns
- [ ] **Short-term**: Define interaction guidelines and micro-animations (300ms transitions)
- [ ] **Long-term**: Implement mobile-first responsive design with 3-breakpoint system

## BMad Integration
- **Documents to Update**: 
  - docs/frontend-spec.md (add design tokens)
  - docs/architecture/ui-standards.md (create new)
- **Stories Impacted**: All Epic 2-6 UI-related stories
- **Architecture Changes**: Component library structure needs to be planned
- **Team Communication**: Share design principles with UX Expert (Chị Lan)

## Follow-up Plan
- **Next Steps**: Implement design token system before starting Epic 2 development
- **Review Schedule**: Check design consistency after each Epic completion
- **Future Consultations**: Re-consult for Trello integration design (Epic 5)

## Impact Assessment
- **Priority**: High - establishes foundation for all future UI work
- **Effort Required**: 4-6 hours to implement design system
- **Risk if Ignored**: Inconsistent UI, poor user experience, technical debt
- **Value if Implemented**: Professional-grade app, faster development, user delight
