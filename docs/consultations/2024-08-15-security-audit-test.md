# Expert Consultation Log - Security Audit

## Session Information
- **Date**: 2024-08-15 16:00
- **Expert**: Chuyên gia bảo mật.md
- **Expert Type**: Technical Security Specialist
- **Session Duration**: 12 minutes
- **Session Type**: Interactive session

## Context
- **Current BMad Agent**: Testing phase (simulated post-Epic 1)
- **Current Task**: Security review of authentication system
- **Project Phase**: Foundation security audit
- **Trigger**: Need security validation before proceeding to team features

## Questions & Responses

### Q1: "Audit TodoFlow authentication system for security vulnerabilities"

**Expert Response:**
Comprehensive security assessment covering:
- Authentication mechanism analysis through OWASP Top 10 lens
- Defense-in-depth security architecture review
- Critical security vectors identification
- Immediate security concerns prioritization

**Key Security Areas Identified:**
1. Session Token Security (JWT implementation)
2. Password Storage (bcrypt verification)
3. HTTPS Enforcement
4. Input Validation (SQL injection/XSS prevention)
5. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection

### Q2: "What about JWT token security specifically?"

**Expert Response:**
Deep dive into JWT security framework including:
- Secure token generation patterns
- Secret management requirements (256-bit minimum)
- Token lifecycle best practices (15-30min expiration)
- Additional security layers (fingerprinting, IP binding)

**Critical Requirements Established:**
- JWT secret rotation quarterly
- Refresh token rotation implementation
- Token blacklisting for secure logout

## Key Insights
- **Main Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive JWT security framework before team features
- **Secondary Points**: Add rate limiting and brute force protection immediately
- **Risks Identified**: Current JWT implementation may lack proper secret management
- **Opportunities**: Establish security-first foundation for team collaboration features

## Action Items
- [ ] **Immediate**: Verify JWT secret strength (256-bit minimum)
- [ ] **Immediate**: Implement token expiration policies (15-30min)
- [ ] **Short-term**: Add rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] **Short-term**: Implement refresh token rotation system
- [ ] **Medium-term**: Add user agent fingerprinting and IP binding
- [ ] **Medium-term**: Create token blacklisting system for logout

## BMad Integration
- **Documents to Update**: 
  - docs/architecture/security-standards.md (create new)
  - docs/prd/security-requirements.md (enhance)
- **Stories Impacted**: All authentication-related stories, Epic 3 team features
- **Architecture Changes**: JWT token management system needs enhancement
- **Team Communication**: Share security requirements with Developer (Anh Tuấn)

## Follow-up Plan
- **Next Steps**: Implement JWT security enhancements before Epic 2
- **Review Schedule**: Security audit after each epic involving user data
- **Future Consultations**: 
  - Team data security review (Epic 3)
  - Real-time feature security (Epic 4)
  - Trello integration security (Epic 5)

## Impact Assessment
- **Priority**: High - critical for user trust and compliance
- **Effort Required**: 6-8 hours for complete JWT security implementation
- **Risk if Ignored**: Data breaches, compromised user accounts, legal liability
- **Value if Implemented**: Enterprise-grade security, user confidence, compliance readiness
